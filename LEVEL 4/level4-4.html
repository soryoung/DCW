         <h1>In winter</h1>
         <h4>By Michael Ryan</h4>
         <br>
         
        <p>&ensp;four o’clock it’s dark.<br>
           Today, looking out through dusk <br></p>
           <br>
        <p>&ensp;at three gray women in stretch slacks <br>
           &ensp;chatting in front of the post office, <br>
           their steps left and right and back <br>
           like some quick folk dance of kindness, <br></p>
           <br>
        <p>I remembered the winter we spent <br>
          &ensp; crying in each other’s laps. <br></p>
           <br>
        <p>What could you be thinking at this moment?</p>
           <br>
        <p>How lovely and strange the gangly spines <br>
           of trees against a thickening sky<br>
           <br>
        <p>as you drive from the library <br>
           humming off-key? Or are you smiling</p>
           <br>
        <p>&ensp;&ensp;at an idea met in a book <br>
           the way you smiled with your whole body</p>
           <br>
        <p>the first night we talked? <br>
           &ensp;I was so sure my love of you was perfect,<br>
           and the light today</p>
           <br>
        <p>reminded me of the winter you drove home <br>
           each day in the dark at four o’clock <br>
           &ensp;and would come into my study to kiss me <br>
           despite mistake after mistake after mistake.</p>
