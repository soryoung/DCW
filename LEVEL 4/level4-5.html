        <h1>In winter</h1>
        <h4>By Michael Ryan</h4>
        <br>

        At&emsp; <strong>f&emsp;o&emsp;u&emsp;r</strong>&emsp; o’clock it’s dark. <br>
        <br>
        Today, looking out through <br>
        at three gray women in str<br>
        etch slacks chatting in fr<br>
        ont of the post office, th<br>
        eir steps left and right a<br>
        nd back like some quick fo<br>
        lk dance of kindness, I re<br>
        membered the winter we spent <br>
        crying in each other’s laps. <br>
        What could you be thinking at this moment? <br>
        How lovely and strange the gangly spines <br>
        of trees against a thickening sky <br>
        as you drive from the library <br>
        humming off-key? Or are you smiling <br>
        at an idea met in a book <br>
        the way you smiled with your whole body <br>
        the first night we talked? <br>
        I was so sure my love of you was perfect, <br>
        and the light today <br>
        reminded me of the winter you drove home <br>
        each day in the dark at four o’clock <br>
        and would come into my study to kiss me <br>
        despite mistake after mistake after mistake. <br>
