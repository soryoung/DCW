        In winter <br> 
        By Michael Ryan<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        At four o’clock it’s dark. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, looking out through dusk <br>
        at three gray women in stretch slacks<br>
        chatting in front of the post office,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        their steps left and right and back<br>
        like some quick folk dance of kindness,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I remembered the winter we spent<br>
        crying in each other’s laps.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What could you be thinking at this moment?<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        How lovely and strange the gangly spines<br>
        of trees against a thickening sky<br>
        as you drive from the library<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        humming off-key? Or are you smiling<br>
        at an idea met in a book<br>
        the way you smiled with your whole body<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        the first night we talked?<br>
        I was so sure my love of you was perfect,<br>
        and the light today<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        reminded me of the winter you drove home<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        each day in the dark at four o’clock<br>
        and would come into my study to kiss me<br>
        despite mistake after mistake after mistake.<br>
