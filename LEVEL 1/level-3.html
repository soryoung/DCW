        <br>
        Today, looking out through dusk<br> 
        at &nbsp&nbspth&nbsp&nbspr&nbsp&nbspe&nbsp&nbspe&nbsp&nbsp gray women in stretch slacks<br>
        chatting&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in front of the post office,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        their steps<br>
        left<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand right<br> 
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand back<br>
        <br>like some quick folk dance of kindness,<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I remembered the winter we spent<br>
        crying in each other’s laps.<br>
        <br>
        
        What could you be thinking at this moment?<br>
        <br>
        
        How lovely and strange the gangly spines<br>
        of trees against a thickening sky<br>
        as you drive from the library<br>
        <br>
        
        humming off&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspkey? Or are you smiling<br>
        at an idea met in a book<br>
        the way you smiled with your whole body<br>
        <br>
        
        the first night we talked?<br>
        I was so sure my love of you was perfect,<br>
        and the light today<br>
        <br>
        
        reminded me of the winter you drove home<br>
        <br>
        
        each day in the dark <br>
                At f<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspu<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspr<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspo’clock<br> 
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit’s dark. <br>
        and would come into my study to kiss me<br>
        despite mistake after mistake after mistake.<br>
