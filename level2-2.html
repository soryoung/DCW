        <h1>In winter </h1>
        <h5>By Michael Ryan<br></h5>
        <br>
        <br>
        At <strong>four</strong> o’clock it’s <strong>dark</strong><br>
        <br>
        Today,<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
        looking out through dusk<br>
        at three gray women in stretch slacks<br>
        chatting in front of the post office,<br>
          <br> 
        their steps left and right and back<br>
        like some quick folk dance of kindness,<br>
        <br> 
        </ul>
       
        I remembered the winter we spent<br>
        crying in each other’s laps.<br>
        
        <br>
        <ul>
          <strong><em>What could you be thinking at this moment?<br></em></strong>
          <br>
          <br>
          
        How lovely and strange the gangly spines<br>
        of trees against a thickening sky<br>
        as you drive from the library<br>
        humming off-key? <br>
          <br>
        Or are you smiling<br>
        at an idea met in a book<br>
        the way you smiled with your whole body<br>
        the first night we talked?<br>
          <br>
        I was so sure my love of you was perfect,<br>
        and the light today<br>
          <br>
          
        reminded me of the winter you drove home<br>
          each day in the <strong>dark</strong> at <strong>four</strong> o’clock<br>
          <br>
          <br>
        <strong><em>and would come into my study to kiss me<br>
          despite mistake after mistake after mistake.<br></strong></em>
          
      </ul>
